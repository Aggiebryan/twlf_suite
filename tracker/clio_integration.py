"""Clio API integration helpers.

This module contains stubbed classes and functions for integrating the
time tracker with Clio, a cloudâ€‘based practice management platform.  In
a production setting, these helpers would handle OAuth2 authentication
flows, fetch matters and contacts, and push time entries to Clio via
their REST API.  The current implementation provides scaffolding for
future development and does not perform any network requests.
